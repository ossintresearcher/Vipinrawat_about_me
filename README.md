🔍 My OSINT Journey
Introduction

Welcome to my repository!
I am an OSINT Researcher exploring the fascinating world of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and its intersection with Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLMs).

This repository is a personal journal of my research, tools, scripts, and findings. It is not just a collection of resources—it reflects my growth as a researcher, my experiments with automation, and my passion for transforming open data into actionable intelligence.

What is OSINT?

OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) is the practice of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting publicly available information to generate valuable insights. Unlike classified intelligence, OSINT is based entirely on legal and ethical sources such as:

🌐 Websites & Online Forums

📰 News Articles & Blogs

📱 Social Media Platforms

📂 Public Records & Databases

📊 Technical Data (WHOIS, DNS, Certificates, Metadata)

The mission of an OSINT researcher is to turn raw information into structured knowledge that supports investigations, cybersecurity, and decision-making.

Why I Chose OSINT

I started this journey because I believe that information is power. Every day, massive amounts of data are created and shared online. Hidden within this data are connections, patterns, and insights that can be used for:

🛡️ Cybersecurity → Detecting threats, leaks, and vulnerabilities.

🕵️ Investigations → Supporting law enforcement and journalism.

📈 Business Intelligence → Understanding markets and competitors.

🌍 Global Awareness → Monitoring events and risks in real time.

The rise of AI/ML has supercharged OSINT research. Tools that once took hours now deliver results in minutes. That inspired me to combine traditional OSINT techniques with AI-powered analysis to scale my work and improve accuracy.

Goals of This Repository

This repo will evolve over time, but my goals are clear:

Document My Learning → Notes, tutorials, and research progress.

Share Useful Tools → Scripts for automation, data collection, and analysis.

Explore AI + OSINT → Experiments with LLMs and ML models for intelligence work.

Build a Resource Hub → Curated links, datasets, and open tools for the community.

Show My Growth → From beginner concepts to advanced projects.

Roadmap
